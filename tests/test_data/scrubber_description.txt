The file set
scrubber_test_1_mate1.fastq
scrubber_test_1_mate2.fastq

was constructed to test the scrubber (human read removal) part of the preprocessing workflow.

It contains three read pairs in two read mate fastq files.

The pairs represent three scenarios as follows, with the base read ID given:
1) human - human: read base ID @SRR062634.10000000 HWI-EAS110_103327062:6:50:17699:19743
2) human - nonhuman: read base ID @SRR062634.10000001 HWI-EAS110_103327062:6:50:17699:1381
3) nonhuman - nonhuman: read base ID @SRR062634.6 HWI-EAS110_103327062:6:1:1119:20104

The outcome of a scrubber run (with option -x) on the above read pairs should be:
1) remove pair
2) remove pair (because one mate is human)
3) keep pair

The files were created as follows:
Public 1000 Genomes data was downloaded from SRA:
$ wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/1000g/ftp/phase3/data/HG00096/sequence_read/SRR062634_1.filt.fastq.gz

scrubber was run to identify human reads and create a fastq file without human reads (-x option)
scrub.sh -i SRR062634_1.filt.fastq -o SRR062634_1.filt_clean_removed.fastq -x

IDs from input and clean file were extracted 
$ grep "^@SR" SRR062634_1.filt.fastq | sort | uniq > SRR062634_1.filt.sorted_ids
$ grep "^@SR" SRR062634_1.filt_clean_removed.fastq | sort | uniq > SRR062634_1.filt_clean_removed.sorted_ids

human read IDs were identified
$ comm -13 SRR062634_1.filt_clean_removed.sorted_ids SRR062634_1.filt.sorted_ids > SRR062634_1.filt_human_read_ids 

picked three human reads from the fastq using IDs from file SRR062634_1.filt_human_read_ids
picked three non-human reads from the file 
SRR062634_1.filt_clean_removed.fastq

changed read IDs to create artificial pairs in the two mate fastq files.

confirmed that the reads are human/nonhuman by running scrubber again on the final test fastq file pair.
$ scrub.sh -i scrubber_test_1_mate1.fastq -o scrubber_test_1_mate1_scrubber_out.fastq -x
$ scrub.sh -i scrubber_test_1_mate2.fastq -o scrubber_test_1_mate2_scrubber_out.fastq -x
-> teh expected reads (non-human) are left in the respective output files
