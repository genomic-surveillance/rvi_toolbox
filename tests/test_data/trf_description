This files descibes the test data set for TRF comprising two files:
trf_test_1_mate1.fastq
trf_test_1_mate2.fastq

The reads in this file have been created to test three scenarios: 
1) both reads have no repeats -> should be in the output
2) one read has repeats, the other does not -> should not be in the output
3) both reads have repeats -> should not be in the output

The read pairs in the files are in this order:
1) norepeat - norepeat: ID A01404:579:579:HVVNFDRX5:2:2122:28076:11569
2) norepeat - repeat: ID A01404:579:HVVNFDRX5:2:2122:28076:11569
3) repeat - repeat: ID A01404:579:HVVNFDRX5:2:2110:32660:9048

Creation of the read files
A real-world production run that used kneaddata (not used anymore) was used as the starting point. Reads identified by kneaddata as having repeats were run through stand-alone trf with the following parameters that are used in the pipeline:
$ trf FILE.fasta 2 7 7 80 10 50 500 -h -ngs 

This identified a single sequence with a repeat according to the above parameters. 
The sequence was used as-is and with some added bases at front to create the "repeat" 
sequences for the test files. Read IDs were changed to create three read pairs in two mate files with 
matching read ID and mate number supplied as "/NUM".
The resulting files were run through trf with above command to confirm the presence/absence of repeats.
